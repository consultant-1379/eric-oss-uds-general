tosca.artifacts.Implementation:
  derived_from: tosca.artifacts.Root
  description: This artifact type represents the parent type for all implementation artifacts in TOSCA. These artifacts are used to implement operations of TOSCA interfaces either directly (e.g., scripts) or indirectly (e.g., config. files).
